    Agreed Sharesport, we can only wait and see. I'm not invested in PHE anymore, but still watch their progress with some interest.

    I didn't realise until now that Tim Yeo joined W2T as a director in June 2019! Though offtopic for here, PHEs takeover doesn't seem to have much relevance given W2T didn't seem to actually _do_ anything.

    What did  W2T actually do, they didn't have any actual listed employees, just the White family and Tim Yeo as directors.

    Seems to have stalled around 18p, is there volume to drive this past those profit taking?
